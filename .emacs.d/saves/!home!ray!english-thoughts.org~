* Start paper prospectus
** What might be good?
   Animal symbolism
*** Wolf
    Lockwood describes the dog he meets as wolfish. Heathcliff
    discourages him from petting it

    Joseph calls "Wolf" (dog name?) to grab Lockwood as he tries to
    run away

    Someone calls heathcliff a potiless, wolfish man.
    (Catherine. I think the old one)

    When isabella first marries Heathcliff, she describes the guy
    he brings her to as a hungry wolf. Who is that?
*** Dog
    46 matches, woah!
    
    Most of them are actual dogs

    One of them is a cat-and-dog combat, between heathcliff and
    Mrs. Heathcliff (who is it at that point? Isabella...?)

    There's the little tiny dog that Isabella gets that sits on the table
    and is then compared to the bull-dog. Skulker
*** Sheep
    All just literal sheep (although they could have symbolism, but no
    people desc as sheep
*** Horse
    Nevermind.
*** Lamb
    Cathy's brother is as uncomplaining as a lamb, but because of
    hardness and not gentleness

    Nelly describes child hareton as her little lamb as she lulls
    him to sleep.

    "Cathy, this lamb of yours [Hareton?] threatens like a bull!"
    - who?

    Then they say that your type is not a lamb, it's a sucking leveret
    (a young hare)

    Later, Nelly "beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth", rocking
    HERSELF in a chair.  Wait was it cathy the whole time? Am I dum?
    - It would make sense, what with mother sheep and daughter lamb and
      different attributes
*** Tiger (tigress)
    Linton is angry when Heathcliff doesn't stop the dogs from
    bothering him, calling them a brood of tigers

    Closing off her letter, Isabella complains about Heathcliff, saying
    that he is scarier than a tiger or a venemous serpent.

    Mrs. Linton calles Cathy(?) a tigress when everyone is talking about her
*** Centipede
    Same as that last tiger reference, with her being alienated
*** Monkey -- wait there are 3 matches?!
    "Little monkey" someone climbs along into a skylight
    Who though? 
    Nelly's POV it seems -- "my fellow servant"

    Mrs. Linton calls Cathy both "a dog in the manger" and "an
    impertinent little monkey

    SOMEONE calls Hareton a "little perishing monkey" because she
    doesn't think Cathy will marry him
    They really are made for each other.
*** Just "beast"
    14 matches...!

    Lockwood calls Joseph a beast of a servant when he stops Skulker

    Hindley and Heathcliff are both called beasts. 
** But also, what has relevant critical stuff?
   Sorta like that one about the centipede from the indies
