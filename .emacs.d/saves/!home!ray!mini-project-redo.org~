* The feedback they gave me
  You did an amazing job with your test cases! Very thorough, and you
  are close to an E.
  
  For an E: [ ] Fix up documentation of your procedures to be entirely
  correct. Comments have been provided to help you locate issues!

  Dale-CHall score.
  
  Overall, you did a great job, and you are very very close to an E!
