  Chapter 4: 2,6, 13, 14, 16, 22, 23, 31,37,43, 56, 63, 75, 78, 91.
  Due in class on Friday
* TODO Go to mathlab and ask about that one question
  Due in class on Wednesday -- but I did most of it already!
* TODO Do the english writeup -- based on the assignment sheet
  Pretty intimidating -- but it's low pressure! Don't sweat it.
* TODO Finish MP3
  I don't have to but it would be nice to submit early
* TODO MP2 redo
  Only do this if I'm desperate for stuff to do.  I have a hunch it
  won't come to that.
