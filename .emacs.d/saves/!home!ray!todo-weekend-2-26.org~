*** TODO Flesh out WH essay
    What do I want to do with it?

    There are so many notes, I just need to choose one and really go
    with it.  This is something I can do, I just need to stay confident
    and make slow and steady progress.
*** TODO Outline of WH essay
    Decide how many paragraphs to use

    Decide what the paras should be about

    Maybe start organizing my ideas together using it as a framework
*** TODO Rough draft of WH essay
    A terribly written thing, but hopefully on that's entirely
    written. I really wanna make this work.0
** TODO Chemistry studying for Friday class material

   sessions, but it's so frustrating to me that it's either them or
   things I actually enjoy
